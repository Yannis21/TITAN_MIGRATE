<p><em><strong><big>ListFiles</big><br>
</strong></em><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp; By Jacques Delannay</small><br>
<br>
<font SIZE="2">When we need to have a list of files that meets certain criterias the only
possibility until now was to write a Dos batch program such as &quot;Dir abc*.* &gt;
liste.tmp&quot;. After executing the batch file, the created file can be read and the info
used by your program.<br>
This could be used<br>
- for creating a list of documents concerning a dossier and giving the user the ability to
choose one of then<br>
- to show all photos concerning a dossier (If the name of the dossier is in the name of
photos)<br>
- ...<br>
<br>
The package that you can download contains the procedure list_file that has as argument
the search_string.<br>
This procedure will fill an array with the name of all the files that meet the
search-string.<br>
It's also possible to make a second array with the size of the files.<br>
<br>
I didn't succeed in getting the file access date and the last modification date of the
file directly from the structure given by Windows. I had to use the Dataflex command
Get_File_Mod_Time to get it. <br>
With the size and the last modification date of the file, we can check if a file we want
to put in this directory is already there. <br>
It's important when a program automatically creates files with a new name. For example my
customer takes Photos and<br>
receives photos from a distinct origin. It's possible that the photo he receives is the
same as a photo he has received from somebody alse. <br>
Instead of showing all photos concerning a dossier and asking the customer if the new
photo is already there, the program could compare the size and the date of the new file
and the others files to see if this photo already exists.<br>
<br>
The test.vw allows you to give the search string and when you press the button, you'll see
the list of files corresponding to the string.</font></font></p>
